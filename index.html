      <h2>From traditional to digital mediums, classical to contemporary subjects— the Philippines has a rich history in the arts, and over the years, had triumphed from such developments. However, once COVID-19 pandemic emerged, the industry was suddenly urged to innovate on their means and methods.</h2>

      <h2>From this pursuit, it seems that Filipinos artists had not only sustained their profession, but helped empower other citizens as well. With that, the question remains: <span>Can arts help promote post-pandemic economic recovery?</span> </h2>

            <h2>Pre-Pandemic Economy</h2>
          </div>
          <p class="justify">
            The onslaught of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic since 2020 has disrupted lifestyles and livelihoods as governments restrict mobility and economic activity in their respective countries. Unfortunately, this caused a -3.36% decline in the 2020 global economy (World Bank, 2022), which will have pushed 71 million people into extreme poverty (World Bank, 2020; 2021). 
          </p>
          <p class="justify">
            As an economic phenomenon, pandemics may be classified under the typologies of disaster economics. Particularly, a pandemic's impacts may be classified according to the following (Benson and Clay, 2004; Noy et al., 2020; Keogh-Brown et al., 2010; 2020; McKibbin and Fernando, 2020; Verikios et al., 2012): (a) direct impacts, where pandemics cause direct labour supply shocks due to mortality and infection; (b) indirect impacts on productivity, firm revenue, household income, and other welfare effects, and; (c) macroeconomic impacts of a pandemic. 
          </p>
          <p class="justify">
            For most pandemic scenarios, social distancing and various forms of lockdowns imposed by countries around the world had led to substantial disruptions in the supply-side of the economy with mandatory business closures (Maital and Barzani, 2020; Keogh-Brown et al., 2010). Social distancing will have contracted labour supply as well, thus contributing to contractions in the macroeconomy (Geard et al., 2020; Keogh-Brown et al., 2010). Thus, in general, the literature points to a pandemic's impacts on the supply- and demand-side, as well as the displacement of labour supply; thus, resulting in lower incomes (Genoni et al., 2020; Hupkau et al., 2020; United Nations Development Programme, 2021). Often, these shocks result from the lockdown measures; thus, a case of a trade-off condition between economic losses and the number of COVID-19 casualties.
          </p><br>
          <div class="section-title">
            <h2>Post-Pandemic Economy</h2>
          </div>
          <p class="justify">
            That said,  to fully recover from the pandemic, the Philippine economy must now meet the following needs of its producers and consumers. Such requires creative, innovative, and time-bound solutions to the following problems: 
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li><u>Inflation Rate:</u></li>
            <p class="justify">As of April 2023, inflation was reported to have decreased to 7.6%, following “eased” prices in transportation, food and beverages, energy, and the like (Rivas, 2023). However, this issue remains a great concern, since it has impacted the cost and accessibility of goods and services across the country. </p>
            <p class="justify">
              In other words, the government needs to implement strategies that help encourage spending and regulate prices which affect supply and demand at the wake of our economic recovery. Canto et al (2023), for one, identified the local travel industry to be substantial in this pursuit, as the “weakening peso” had fuelled more interest in domestic expenditures. Hence, the administration can take advantage of this interest by drawing attention to uniquely-Filipino products and experiences.
            </p>
            <li><u>Unemployment Rate:</u></li>
            <p class="justify">
              On one hand, the Philippine Statistics Authority (2023) have reported a 95.2% employment rate as of February 2023, citing “wholesale”, “accommodation and food service”, and “agriculture and forestry” as the highest three subsectors by this measure. But, on the other hand, there had also been a decrease of employees in industries such as “health and social work”, “construction”, “mining and quarrying”, “information and communication”, and “manufacturing” (PSA, 2023). Clearly, post-pandemic working conditions were not made equal for all livelihoods. 
            </p>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-12 pt-4 pt-lg-0  content" data-aos="fade-right">
          <p class="justify">
            To resolve this issue, a smooth transition must occur from home-based to blended and/or face-to-face working environments—and this can best be achieved through the integration of physical and digital workspaces. An article by the Asian Development Bank (2023) had suggested that having “public infrastructure” is key to economic growth as this bridges the consumers to producers. Moreover, it can be argued that sustaining the digital infrastructure used during the pandemic—such as remote working office arrangements, tools, and software—could provide buisinesses with alternate means of operation. All in all, by granting more flexibility through such innovations, employees can be more productive as they shift into the “new normal”. 
          </p>
          <ol start="3">
            <li><u>Supply and Demand:</u></li>
            <p class="justify">
              Guild (2023) shared that the 2022 economy had followed a “consumption-based model” as the country aimed to restore pre-pandemic levels of productivity. Yet, given the aforementioned states of inflation and unemployment, as well as this myriad of socio-political matters, it seems that progress will be inevitably slow. Despite improvement in recent months, concerns over food security still persist due to conflicts like inflation costs, global politics, technological divide, climate change, and such (ADB, 2023). Therefore, without the proper platforms and procedures in place, industries would likely struggle to scale their needs and operate on nationwide basis. 
            </p>
            <p class="justify">
              In this case, the government must focus its efforts on Philippine agriculture—that is, by improving funding, equipment, and labor conditions—to best support their working practices. Furthermore, media platforms could also contribute by bringing awareness to consumer needs and issues, as well as by representing different areas of the local economy.
            </p>
          </ol>
          <p class="justify">
            In summary, the Philippine economy is steadily improving after most COVID-19 pandemic restrictions have been lifted—yet, there is still much work to be done in order to fully normalize production, consumption, and employment within the country. Based on these findings, it appears that the administration needs to address these three things in particular: 
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li><u>Accessibility:</u></li>
            <p class="justify">
              Since the pandemic had significantly reduced access to goods and services, as well as limited the capacity for businesses to operate, the Philippine economy had been roughly hit; and is currently attempting to diminish the impact of inflation and unemployment. As face-to-face activity has now resumed, the government now needs to ensure that all industries and their consumers can make this transition without risk.
            </p>
            <li><u>Innovation:</u></li>
            <p class="justify">
              Both physical and digital infrastructures are needed to increase productivity, bridge citizens together, and revitalize industries that had been tragically cut-off during the pandemic. It is pertinent for Filipino businesses and consumers to learn how to navigate such innovations in order to incentivize expenditure, develop more economic opportunities, and work in the “new normal”. 
            </p>
            <li><u>Awareness:</u></li>
            <p class="justify">
              Ultimately, these issues cannot be resolved without spreading due awareness about current events; consumers and industries alike suffer under the blind eye of ignorance and inaction. Thus, the government and the media should utilize available platforms to make known the present economic conditions, as this may potentially empower the push for change. 
            </p>
          </ol>
          <p class="justify">
            All in all, the Philippine economy needs to address high inflation, unemployment, and supply and demand needs to fully restore operations. Although, for this to happen, the administration has to revitalize the interest in domestic products, services, events, technologies, and the like to overcome the effects of the pandemic. Certain industries can definitively set this trend—but which ones should we place our hopes on? Well, perhaps we could look no further than art!

              <p class="justify">The COVID-19 pandemic has brought the handicraft industry to its knees, especially during the period of lockdowns. Handicrafts were tagged as non-essential, causing many artisans to lose their livelihoods. The prohibition of face-to-face gatherings has also prevented sales at trade fairs and opportunities to teach the practice to the next generation. Hence, promoting this industry is something we must consider. But what exactly would the impact of promoting this industry be-- both to our country's economic recovery and to the artisans themselves? <a href="h_promo.html" style="color: whitesmoke;" data-gallery="handicraftDetailsGallery" data-glightbox="type: external" class="portfolio-details-lightbox"><u>Read more</u>..</a></p>

            The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted various aspects of life, including economic, artistic, and personal development. The lack of access, inventiveness, and awareness in society requires imaginative solutions to address the growing prices and unemployment rates. Although the Philippine economy is improving, more effort is required to stabilize output, consumption, and employment fully. To mitigate the consequences of the epidemic, the administration must promote domestic products, services, events, and innovations. Additionally, film, visual, and culinary arts are vital to Filipino culture, entertainment, and economic development. Filipino films typically center on family, community, and romantic connections, reflecting the culture of the nation. The top-grossing films have features such as well-known stars, directors, relatable stories, and holiday release dates. Philippine film festivals promote local filmmakers and create career possibilities. Visual arts have a rich history in the Philippines; however, the country has failed to understand and embrace the potential of creative industries compared to other ASEAN countries.
          </p>
          <p class="justify">
            Ultimately, the Philippine Creative Industries Act intends to develop and improve creative sectors affected by the pandemic's potential in the global market. Creating art galleries also helps the economy of a country. The "Titikman o Tatakpan" mini-survey highlights Filipino cuisine's various tastes, taking influences from Spanish, Chinese, Malay, and indigenous traditions. Culinary arts promote employment growth and cultural tourism by increasing demand for local food items and services. Social media platforms such as TikTok, Instagram, Youtube, and Facebook have assisted in promoting local businesses and different gastronomic choices to a larger audience, hence driving economic growth.
          </p>
          <p class="justify">
            The handicrafts industry, especially, is one of the biggest local arts industries in the country. Because of our bountiful resources of natural materials such as bamboo and coconut shells, our handicrafts industry has been active for centuries. When tourists travel to different cities and provinces of the Philippines, one of the most important things they do before leaving is exploring the local handicrafts in search of souvenirs or "pasalubong", which is proof enough of how integral this industry is to the individual culture of each area and to the overall economy of the Philippines. The sales of our handicrafts take up a great chunk of the country's foreign exchange earnings, but it has yet to reach its fullest potential. Though there are well over 1 million Filipinos working under the handicrafts industry, many still lack proper education on the technicalities of entering the market, and with the surge in online shopping over the past few years, there are added opportunities for foreign exchange that are yet to be explored. Our local arts communities in general have contributed greatly to the Philippine economy, and if funded and promoted properly, these communities will continue to flourish. We believe that with proper local and international advertising as well as educational courses or seminars on the market offered in rural communities, the Philippine handicrafts industry can grow to become one of the most well-known arts industries in the world, ultimately leading to a great rise in the economy.
