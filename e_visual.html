            <h2>Exploring PH Arts</h2>
            <p>Visual Arts</p>
          </div>
            <p>
              Visual arts in the Philippines came to prominence in the 1960s which led to the emergence of a brilliant breed of younger artists who tackled cultural or social issues, local customs or traditions, and indigenous cultures with an artistic verve. The Philippine contemporary visual arts have significantly explored a variety of Western and Eastern styles, media, and philosophies to express themselves as individuals and as Filipinos (Manores, 2016).
            </p>
            <p>
              Through traditional art paintings, one of the leading social realist painters, Renato Habulan, acquired a semiotic richness derived from the different aspects of contemporary experience (Alice Guillermo). Some works such as those of Vicente Manansala also contributed to the development of a Philippine genre in the modernist idiom with his own style of transparent cubism.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            With the existing computer technologies, graphic designs are also rampant these days in which artists give form to books, magazines, websites, advertisements, and other graphic messages (Marcus, 2002). </p>
          <p>
            Dan Matutina, a Philipines-based designer/illustrator is one of the well-known Filipino graphic artists who received the Art Directors Club Young Guns Award in New York. Moreover, Jowee Alviar, the co-founder of one of the frontrunners and flag-bearers of Filipino design, “Team Manila”, humbly owes their work to the country’s rich history of graphic design. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite the great reputation that the Philippines have in terms of creativity, many Filipino artists often negotiate contracts of purchases or commissions on their own rather than go through dealers or art managers because of the glaring need for Philippine creative economy legislation. And as our own ASEAN neighbors outrank the Philippines in establishing creative industries development agencies and growth agendas, Filipinos still leaned on having world-class talents who have found success outside their own land. It was also reported that the most salient issue in the founding of the Art Association of the Philippines (AAP), an association for artists, collectors, benefactors, and enthusiasts, was its professionalization. What’s more, is that the COVID-19 pandemic has devastated several creative industries including folk arts.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The truth of the matter is that the Philippines is over 20 years behind other countries in recognizing and embracing the potential of creative industries,” Paolo Mercado points out, the founder and president of the Creative Economy Council of the Philippines.
          </p>
          <p>
            As Paolo Mercado advocates for the Philippines to adopt a more creative economy in its long attempt to dig itself from the economic doldrums, filling House Bill No. 8101 or the Philippine Creative Industries Act promotes creative sectors that are negatively affected by the pandemic to survive this crisis. This bill can also help sectors poised to grow to get the necessary assistance and incentives to strengthen their opportunities in the global markets.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tourists may not only go to the Philippines just to look at its hotels, bridges, or buildings, but they also visit to seek to behold its arts. With that, establishing art galleries can also energize the ecology of art in the Philippines wherein many Filipino artists will have an opportunity to rise. Besides, galleries also represent the symbols of the country’s excellence.
          </p>
          <p>Even though there are still creative industries that are poised to grow during the drastic time of the pandemic like e-commerce-related digital marketing and advertising, and digital design services, having proper knowledge about employment and business opportunities, or how artists price their works or productions must also be taken into account as it can contribute to the nation’s economy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dela Cruz, a senior graphic designer says, “I do dream of the day when Filipino artists can be given a venue where they can show the world what they’ve got” (Hidalgo, 2022).
