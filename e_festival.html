                  <p class="justify">
                    The Kadayawan Festival is an annual event held in Davao City, Philippines that celebrates the bounties of nature and culture. The name "Kadayawan" originates from the Dabawenyo dialect's word "Madayaw," which means good, superior, valuable, or beautiful. The festival is an occasion of gratitude and appreciation for the bountiful harvest and tranquility. The Kadayawan Festival is rooted in the ancient traditions of the indigenous tribes of Mindanao, where they would converge at the foot of Mount Apo for a thanksgiving ritual after a successful harvest. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="justify">
                    The festival was founded in 1986 as a culmination of several tribal celebrations aimed at showcasing the gratitude rituals of Mindanao's indigenous peoples. Despite the changing times, the Dabawenyos have continued to practice the traditional thanksgiving or "pahinungod" to the gods, particularly the "Manama" or the Supreme Being. The Kadayawan Festival has evolved into a colorful and energetic week-long celebration of life and bountiful harvests, featuring street dancing, floral parades, and various cultural presentations. It is an opportunity to showcase the rich and diverse culture of Mindanao and express gratitude for nature's blessings.

              <h2>Economic Impact</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="justify">
              Besides being known as the expression of Filipino culture, holding festivals often gives an additional economic boost to a community. Organizing events such as festivals that were primarily used by urban areas helps them market their locality for tourism. Although visitors from other places often take for granted the cultural aspects of festivals, this can also promote a sense of belongingness which influences the outsiders to come and visit their community more often and sometimes stays for good. On the other hand, during festival season, additional spending for the local government units is seen as capital for more revenues to be collected. Yet, it can also highlight the increasing demand for products and services found in that locality only.
            </p>
            <p class="justify">
              The province of Batangas that is known for its “Ala Eh! Festival” – the biggest, grandest, and most colorful event in the province echoes the same economic benefits of having festivals in their locality revealing a composite mean of 3.44, interpreted as agreed. Furthermore, the Barangay captains said that after having the festival, there are some potential investors that set an appointment with them and discuss some projects that would be of great benefit to the locality. 
            </p>
            <p class="justify">
              Being the highest ranking factor for the economic benefits, festivals truly uplift the tourism industry of Batangas Province, not just Batangas but all those who are having this kind of activity. As more tourists visit their place, the residents, as well as the local government unit will gain more income.
